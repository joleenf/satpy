    Reader for official data products from the Climate Monitoring
    Satellite Application Facility (CMSAF).  At present, this is developed
    as a reader for the instantaneous non-statistical Meteosat Third
    Generation MSG SEVIRI cloud products in NetCDF4 format, but it may
    work for other products with little or perhaps no modification.
    Information on CMSAF and its products can be found at
